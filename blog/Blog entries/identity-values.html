        <h2 class="p-subject">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h2>
        <p>In a previous work role I was a health and safety representative and as a part of the role I had to work to strive for better health, safety, and wellbeing of other employees. I was faced with a difficult decision of whether I should report a forklift accident or not. The incident did not cause anyone harm, however I believed that it could have very well harmed one or more people if the circumstances were slightly different. The problem with reporting it was that it would make the forklift driver's job a lot more difficult - with new health and safety regulations being put in place to prevent it. I ended up reporting the incident regardless, I believe that the health and safety of the workers was more important than their workload. If I were in that position again I would without a doubt make that call again, and report the incident.

        <h2 class="p-subject">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life I have had many external influences on my values and identity. The largest of which being my family and friends that have surrounded me. I have been raised to always ask questions and to look for deeper meaning in the answers that are given to me. I think this is likely why, love of learning is my top strength. I was also strongly encouraged to stand up for what I believe is right, as well as to take ownership of my actions and words. I think that these are the reasons that my values have become: responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and courage.

        <h2 class="p-subject">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

<p><strong>Love of learning</strong> - Taking interest in learning new things, reading, school-work. To me this strength means: bettering my knowledge of the world, and striving for better. I think it will help me in my learning journey by giving me a strong motive and enthusiasm to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Prudence</strong> - I am a careful person, and my choices are consistently prudent ones. I typically don't say things I regret. To me this means: Precision, efficiency, careful, cautious. This will help me in my learning journey as it will mean I can work at a very efficent level and I will be more likely to make careful decisions when learning.</p>
<p><strong>Judgement</strong> - Reliance on solid evidence/facts and not jumping to conclusions. To me this means: analysing sources and people to determine their validity, and then relating to what I know and making informed decisions with that information. This will help in my learning journey as it means I will look for the finer details when looking at sources of information.</p>
<p><strong>Honesty</strong> - I am an Honest person, living life in an authentic way, down to earth. To me this means: Brutal truth, speaking my mind, and not allowing corruption of integrity. I think this will help me in my learning journey as it will make it easy for me to speak out to others if I think something is not right.</p>
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
</h2>
        <p>
          <p>NOTE: Although I do not see these as 'limitations' per se, I acknowledge these as  'my lesser strengths' or 'things to work on'.

</p>
        <p>Self Regulation - Regulating what one feels and does; being disciplined; controlling one's impulses and emotions. For me: this is likely due to me being ASD and innately not being able to regulate my emotions as well as others typically could. Although this does not mean I can't strive every day to get to a point where I can more efficiently regulate my emotions - It just requires more work as it doesn't come naturally for me. This could affect my learning journey by making me especially more stressed during naturally stressful times. However I have some good strategies to cope with this, such as staying on top of my work as much as possible. “Stress comes from not taking action on something that you can/could've taken action on”
</p>
        <p>Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence - Noticing and appreciating beauty, excellence, and/or skilled performance in various domains of life, from nature to art, to mathematics, to science, and to everyday experience. For me: I believe this is likely due to me not explicitly looking out for 'beauty and excellence' In my everyday life. However It is something that I have been as well as am still working on. It is very important to acknowledge excellence and beauty, especially in my peers around me - good to let peers and family know they are doing well, through reassurance. This may affect my Learning Journey when I need to do peer or self reflection… I may not naturally look for the things that went well, and might focus more on the things that went wrong - not necessarily a bad thing, depending on the person receiving the feedback.
</p>
        <p>Gratitude - Being aware of and thankful for the good things that happen; taking time to express thanks. For me: I believe this may affect my learning journey by limiting my ability to naturally be grateful for my own accomplishments in life and whilst learning. I should make sure to practice gratitude daily (5 things I am grateful for at the beginning of each day).

        <h2 class="p-subject">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
</h2>
        <p>In my last full time job in the freezing-works I encountered a few colleagues that were difficult to cooperate with. It was a high stress environment, and everyone wanted to do their part and finish the work they had to do, sometimes there would be clashes of priority. A good strategy I found to be effective was to let other teams know as far ahead of time as possible when we required them to do something. Sometimes this meant taking extra time to plan and strategize with other team leaders in order to get all the jobs done that we needed to. It seemed to work quite well and I would definitely use this strategy again. I came to learn very quickly that team-work is a much better solution than trying to do everything on my own.
