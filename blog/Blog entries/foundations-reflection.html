          Three things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to Human Skills learning
        </h2>
          <p>
            I have learnt that throughout this course there have been lots of challenges that require determination, effort, and practice, in order to overcome them. I have also learnt that I need to be patient with myself when learning and to take my time whilst working from the course material. I now know that I need to take breaks from studying frequently, in order to keep my mind fresh and my problem solving abilities the best I can.

          The roles of: values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming
        </h2>
          <p>
            Understanding our values can be very important when programming as they give us insight into why we are doing what we are doing. They come as a reminder of who we are and we can use them to better our learning journey to becoming a programmer. Empathy in learning and programming can be seen mostly at a personal level. We need to be empathetic towards ourselves when learning as we are bound to get things wrong all the time. Part of the process of learning is making mistakes to learn from them, you have to have a little empathy for yourself in order to deal with that. Self-awareness is also very important when learning and programming as we need to be aware when we are going aromund in circles and not getting anything done. Sometimes it's good to be aware that you just need a break from what it is you are doing, and to come back to it later.

          The most surising things from Human Skills learning
        </h2>
          <p>
            I found the stuff around neuroplasticity to be the most suprising, and interesting. I also found the mediation we did to be suprisingly helpful when I gave them a go. I was suprised that it would be so helpful at drawing out all of my attention to focus on my breath, or the mediation practice I was doing. It was really helpful when I did meditation before starting the day, and I was suprised with how much more focused I was the days that I did mediate before study.

          The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning
        </h2>
          <p>
            I found the listening and looping to be the most challenging. It definitely put me out of my comfort zone when we were doing the exercises, it felt weird to have somones complete attention for 120 seconds. However, I am really glad I did the listening and looping exercises as it was good being put out of my comfort zone and to converse with strangers.

          Why I think DevAcademy spends so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course
        </h2>
          <p>
            I know from first hand experience that to be a great co-worker, boss, friend, family member, pretty much everthing you can be, you need to have good people skills. If you can effectively deal with any human situation using your words, you can save so much time in life, work, buisness, to do other things. Human skills is what takes you from being a good co-worker / boss, to being an amazing one. Also I am aware of the stereotype of programmers not being the most socially friendly of people so maybe this is to break that stigma? Either way, good human skills are great to have no matter where you end up going in life.

          Do I think the time I spent studying human skills here is a waste of time?  
        </h2>
          <p>
            No, I think it's actually a really good use of time. You can only get so far in life with technical skills, that doesn't just mean in programming, but arts, trades industy, whatever it is, people skills is what makes the difference. It's also been great to learn that intelligence earnt through hard work and practice, rather than the idea that it is inherited at birth. I think these are good things to learn about before embarking on a course where we are going to learn a whole lot, and also make a lot of mistakes. It's reassuring to have in the back of our minds that every mistake we make is only making us smarter and slowly understanding programming more and more.
