        <h2 class="p-subject">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity we can understand that skill or intelligence can be earned through hard work and repetition. Intelligence is not hard wired into our brains at birth, but rather that we increase intelligence by constantine stimulating the brain. When we practice something over and over again, we are using the same neural pathways each time we do an activity. By constantly stimulating those neural pathways we are strengthening our brains' familiarity with that task. “Practice makes permanent”.
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">How can I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit
        </h2>
        <p>I will use the principles of neuroplasticity throughout this course by trying my best to practice coding every day. By doing the DevAcademy work, or coding on freeCodeCamp each day, I am stimulating the neural pathways that are associated with programming. If I continue to do this daily, my skills in programming will accelerate at a very fast rate, compared to if I were to practice programming less often. This will help me stay on top of things at DevAcademy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
        </h2>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation is a great way to increase your neuroplasticity. By focusing on the mediation that you are doing, you reduce stress, calm your brain, and move yourself into a focussed state. Another way to increase neuroplasticity is by practicing new things, and to do them regularly. By removing the state of familiarity of routine practices, we cause our brains to focus on the new thing that we are learning. Quality sleep is also another way to increase your neuroplasticity, by ensuring you have enough time asleep, and that it is uninterrupted, you increase your focus the following day.

        <h3 class="p-sub-subject">A resource that I found particularly useful / engaging
        </h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain">Link Here </a>I thought this was a really good article as the steps seemed straightforward to follow. The tasks they have you do seem to be pretty fun, or creative too, so you have something to take from it other than increasing neuroplasticity.

        <h2 class="p-subject">Growth Mindset, what it is and why it is relevant
        </h2>
        <p>Growth mindset is a state of mind that moves away from the mindset of ‘I can’t do that’, and helps us understand, ‘I can’t do that YET’. A strong growth mindset is relevant as in life we are always going to encounter new things, and we are probably going to suck at them at first. But with a strong growth mindset, we will slowly get better and better each day.
</p>
        <h3 class="p-sub-subject">Suprises
        </h2>
        <p>I was surprised that practicing meditation helped improve neuroplasticity. It does make sense though now that I think about it. It’s a really good way to ensure your brain is focussed and ready for whatever is next.
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey
        </h2>
        <p>Everything programming is pretty new to me, and I understand I have a whole lot to learn. By employing a strong growth mindset I can assure myself that I won’t give up throughout the duration of this course. By sticking at it and continuing to give things a go, even when they are hard, I will improve at a really strong pace.
</p>
        <h3 class="p-sub-subject">Another resource that I found particularly useful / engaging
        </h3>
        <p><a href=" https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/careers/develop-growth-mindset/">Link Here </a>I thought this resource was particularly helpful as It explains growth mindset, and how to build one.
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">How all of these understandings will shape my learning plan and strategy</h2>
        <p>All this stuff I have just learned about neuroplasticity and growth mindset will be very helpful for me when I'm feeling like giving up. I can always think back, practice is the only thing that will make me better at something. And that I am definitely capable of anything, with the right attitude, mindset, and repetition.
