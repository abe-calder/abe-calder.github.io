          A time I was blocked on a simple problem
        </h2>
          <p>
            During the Javascript Kata FlipFlop challenge, I was blocked on the challenge as I couldn't get the test to pass and wasn't sure what was wrong. I had my FlipFlop function with if statements that used the remainder operator to check if a number was divisible by 15, 5, or 3. I had a feeling that the if statements were correct and I was getting confused why the tests weren't passing. I kept looking at the code and wondering why I wasn't working as it should, it was a bit frustrating and felt like I couldn't figure it out. But, after trying lots of different things over and over it ended up passing. I was putting the if statements, which check if a number is divisible by, 3, 5, or 15, in the wrong order. Since 15 is divisible by 3 and 5, it needs to be run first in the code, then the condition that check if a number is divisible by 5 is next, and then 3.

            Whilst completing the builtin-methods challenges I dound myself getting stuck on a few of them, to name one, the deBee challenge. The challenge involved taking a string (sentence in this case), and splitting all of the words up, then removing all the words that say buzz (lower and uppercase), then joining the string back together. I was able to split the sentence up on my own and I could see that it was working as I was console logging to see what was coming out from the code. But the problem was that I was stuck on filtering out the words 'buzz' and removing them. I ended up looking on google and youtube and found a good video that showed a similar coding example with a walkthrough on how to solve it and what things mean with the code. I found this to be very helpful and was able to solve the challenge without resorting to any other problem solving skills.

          Confidence of using problem solving techniques
        </h2>
          <p>
            Throughout these 4 sprints at DevAcademy so far I have been able to put alot of different problem solving skills to the test. I have found that pseudocoding has been very helpful for me. However, I wish I used it more, especially in the javascript kata challenges, I feel im pretty confident with them however. 'Trying something' is also another problem solving skill that I used many times, especially when coding. When im not sure exactly what to do, I start trying things until I get it, im very confident with this problem solving skill and use it alot. The 'rubber ducky method', which involves explaining your problem to an inatimate object like a rubber duck, is one im not super confident with. I already sort of do it in my head, so when it comes time to using the rubber ducky method I end up having to resort to google. Reading error messages has been very helping when coding, however im not very confident with all of the messages that come through. Some of the messages I have no idea what they mean, but I have put to use some of the errror messages that I did understand what they mean - google helps when I don't know what the message means.

            Console logging whilst coding has proved to be very effective and helpful in understanding what the code that I have just written is doing. I'm quite confident with this technique and it is one of my favourite to use as I can be see what actually happens with the code I have just done. Googling is another that I have used a bunch throughout the entire foundations so far. It's great that there is always a resource for everything, and with the right searches you can solve many problems. I am definetly quite confident with the problem solving technique. Asking my peers for help is a technique that I have used a bit aswell, I asked one of the people in my homegroup for advice when setting up my second blog entry. I have also asked coaches / my homegroup facillator for help (Joseph) when doing the super flip flop challenge, I am very confident with both of these techniques. Reflection is another thing that I have found to be extremely useful when problem solving, to reflect over everything I have just done in the task is great. It gives me a chance to go through step by step and see what I have done to try and figure out where I could have gone wrong, I am fairly confident with this too.

          A time when I was reluctant to ask for help
        </h2>
          <p>
            In the super flip flop challenge I needed to ask Joseph for help as I was getting blocked and couldn't figure the problem out. I was slighltly reluctant to ask for help, as the last time I asked for help I ended up solving the problem about 30 minutes later. I thought that this might be the case again with the super flipflop challenge so I questioned whether I should bother him or not. I felt more stuck than the last time so I ended up asking for help anyway. This ended up being a good idea and im glad that I did it ask he linked a video walkthrough that I was able to follow along with. Next time I think I would still ask for help, as i'm not sure I could have figured it out on my own, I had already been trying things for about 25 minutes, and I felt I wasn't getting any closer.
