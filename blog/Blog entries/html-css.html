        <h4 class="p-subject">When to use Classes</h4>
        <p>
          Classes are a type of attribute that can be applied to HTML elements.
          The cool thing about the class attribute is that it can be applied to
          multiple elements throughout a single HTML page. Class attributes
          should always be your first go-to option when you are giving
          attributes to elements... This is because you can always override a
          class attribute by using an id attribute. If you wanted certain
          elements to have the same style you would use a class attribute -
          because you can use the same class throughout different elements,
          across a single document.
        </p>
        <h4 class="p-subject">When to use id's</h4>
        <p>
          id's are another type of attribute that can be applied to HTML
          elements. One thing about the id attribute is that you can only use an
          id once, in one location, throughout a single HTML page. id attributes
          can be used for specific styling in a webpage, if you want to style
          one element and override previous class attribute styling for that
          element. A useful technique to use an id attribute is if you want to
          include an anchor tag in your webpage. You can use the id attribute as
          a reference point for text that is up and down a webpage (when you use
          the scroll bar). I will have a demonstration of this at the end of
          this Blog post to show an example of an anchor tag being used in a
          webpage.
        </p>
        <h4 class="p-subject">Classes and id's in CSS</h4>
        <p>
          When working with class and id attributes in CSS, the two different
          attributes act the same when CSS applies the styling. Technically you
          could use either attribute when applying styling in CSS... However, as
          stated above it is always good practice to use the class attribute
          first - you can always override it later with an id attribute if you
          need. In order to select a class when we are styling in CSS we can use
          the class selector. The class selector is a period '.' + the class
          name 'class-name-here' + a space ' ' and + some curly brackets '{}'.
          Similar to class selectors, we also have id selectors, we can use
          these to access a specific id on a page. The id selector is a hash key
          '#' + the id name 'id-name-here' + a space ' ' + some curly brackets
          '{}'.
