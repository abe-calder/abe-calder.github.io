        <h2 class="p-subject">What is Emotional Intelligence?
</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is our ability to recognise, understand, influence, and utilize our own, and others emotions. Emotional intelligence is crucial when we want to build on human skills such as, motivation, empathy, social skills, self regulation and awareness.  We can use a 3 step approach to improve our emotional intelligence. 
</p>
<p>The First is to practice mindfulness, mindfulness can help us stay focused and improve attention. Mindfulness can be powerful when we want to understand our emotions, rather than being controlled or possessed by them. There is a difference between ‘being angry’, and ‘noticing when you are experiencing anger’. Mindfulness can teach us to be aware when we experience angry emotions, rather than saying or doing things that are the product of our anger. 
</p>
<p>The next step to emotional intelligence is self-knowledge and self-mastery. This is the ability to understand what is going on for ourselves internally and being able to deal with those feelings/emotions appropriately. This can be as simple as understanding that on a  particular day you might be angry, you know how angry you are, and you understand how to regulate it. 
</p>
<p>The last step of emotional intelligence is creating useful mental habits. This is the practice of training our mental state to ask ourselves positive and useful questions such as, ‘Today will be a good day, I am going to get x, y, z done and I hope everyone else has a productive day’. This can train our mind to develop habits that will work against our superego, the judging portion of our minds. 
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">How is EQ different to IQ?
</h2>
        <p>EQ focuses on our ability to understand our emotions in an effective way, whilst our IQ focuses on our analytical thinking. Whilst IQ is important in work or study life, the EQ is actually twice as important as the IQ when it comes to effectiveness when studying/working. The EQ focuses on the ability we have to express, regulate and monitor our emotions, and feelings of ourselves, and others we are working with. This could be presented as having an understanding that someone else, or yourself, is angry on a particular day, and the strategies you will use to deal with the anger. IQ is different as it focuses on a person's intellectual or academic intelligence. This could be presented through someone's understanding of complex technical concepts, or how efficiently they can code. 
</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>EQ is important as it helps us stay alert and grounded to others, and our own feelings. It prompts us to recognise smaller details in someone that could suggest certain feelings, attitude, or emotions. With the recognition of said feelings we can use that knowledge to employ a strategy to work more effectively based on what we know about our own, or someone else's feelings or emotions. 
</p>
        <p>Everyone experiences feelings of anger, sadness, or frustration in their lives. By developing our EQ we can get good at dealing with these feelings and using them to be better at evaluating and dealing with situations. We can use our EQ to work with our emotions, rather than allowing our emotions to influence us. 
</p>
        <p>A strong EQ is extremely important especially when we move into leadership roles. As leaders we are required to check in with team members and monitor emotions and feelings to improve the quality of teamwork. By understanding a little about the emotions that our co-workers/learners are experiencing we can form an idea as to how we can approach them and what strategies we can use to get them working effectively.</p>
