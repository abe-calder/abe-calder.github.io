            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </h2>
            <p>
              I aim to reach a point where I can work remotely around the world. The plan is to use the rest of my 20s exploring as much of the world as I can whilst working at the same time. Rather than working for a year or two and saving up to go travelling, I'd rather work and travel at the same time. I hope to slowly start climbing the career ladder in the field of web development. But honestly, anything in tech where I can stimulate my brain will be great for me.

            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          </h2>
            <p>
              I think my biggest strength will be that when I get into my groove and have lots of work to do, I find I am at my happiest and most functional. I love it when there are always things to do. My biggest limitation might be trying to find a good free time - study time ratio. I don’t want to be overworked all the time, but I also want to make sure I get everything done and I stay on top of things.

            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Maybe that it might be hard to connect with the other students as the bootcamp section got moved to all online now. I was looking forward to doing it in person, but unfortunately we got moved to the online bootcamp. We should still be able to connect and work cooperatively with other students, but it won’t be the same, so it might just be a little harder online.

            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
            <p>
              I would really like to get better at forming my questions that I have when I am asking for help. Even when typing out questions on discord, I would like to make my question more clear and concise. I also want to improve my teamwork skills throughout bootcamp, teamwork skills are very useful wherever you end up in life.

            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          </h2>
            <p>
              I expect that they provide us with the necessary resources to get our tasks done. I would also expect that they would let me know if I am falling behind and to offer help. I would also expect that when I ask them for help that they will do their best to help me out.

            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
          </h2>
            <p>
              My expectations of myself for bootcamp are to stay on top of the workload, if possible. To reach out for help when I am getting blocked on things, and to make sure that I give myself enough breaks and free time. I also expect that I will sleep well, and that I won’t let the workload get to me and stress me out. I also expect that I will make mistakes and that I should understand that and not freak out when they happen.
            </p>

        <h1 class="p-sub-subject">Foundations Learning plan:</h1>
        <h2 class="p-subject">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My long term goal / career pathway is to change into a position where I can work remotely. I hope to move into a career in web-development, and wish to eventually be able to do remote work from home, and other countries; as I would like to do some travelling at some stage in my 20s. I know that web-devs can sometimes have the ability to work fully remote, this is one of the reasons I have chosen to study at DevAcademy. I also want to move to a career where I can climb the career ladder more so than my last job - more advancement opportunities.</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </h2>
        <p>My biggest strength when it comes to learning is that I love constantly learning new things, and keeping my brain stimulated. By constantly learning and growing I can keep myself engaged with the work I am doing, as well as keeping my brain busy. Another one of my strengths when it comes to learning is prudence. This is a good strength to have when learning as it helps me assure myself that the decisions and actions I make are going to be ones that are thought out. Another strength I have is that I find it easy to reach out for help when I think I am stuck. I first look through the internet and see if I can find any resources that can answer my question, then I reach out to specific people.
        </p>
        <p>One of my limitations when it comes to learning is that I often can work at a pace that can be a little too fast for some situations. I like to take my time when soaking in resources and material, but often find myself speeding up when it comes to applying the knowledge. This can lead to some small mistakes here and there, but mistakes are good as they allow us to grow. Another limitation is that I can sometimes try to move ahead too quickly instead of just taking things as they come. I've done this a few times already in this course where I went onto google to find things out that I later naturally found out through the course material.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>I would like to develop some better skills when it comes to teamwork and delegating workloads around a team. I have some foundation work done on this in a previous course I have done, but I would really like to improve on my teamwork skills. I believe teamwork is the most important skill to have when working or studying. I would also quite like to get better social skills with people that I am working with. E.g. Checking in with group / team members regularly to see how everyone is going, and any issues that they are facing. Finally, I would like to get better at reflection. It is a skill that I have utilized in past work roles, but for different situations. I never thought to apply this when learning, but have learnt it is a valuable skill to have.</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        </h2>
        <h3 class="p-sub-subject">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
        <p>Throughout this course I will aim to try and have regular check-ins with other learners that I am working with. This could present as checking what eachothers workload will be like for the day, as well as formulating a plan to tackle the work for each day. I also want to get into the habit of kindly asking the facilitators for help whenever I am stuck and can’t find answers through the internet. I also want to get into a clear habit of a structured routine where I work for a set amount of hours each day and repeat it each day. I have already started doing this as I often start my day at 8:30am and aim to be finished by 5:30pm or 6:30pm depending on the workload. This is to ensure that if others want to communicate with me I am always available between the hours of 8:30am and 5:30pm.</p>
        <h3 class="p-sub-subject">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </h3>
        <p>When things are progressively building up, and beginning to get to me, I will be able to reach out to someone. In group work especially, I will be able to reach out to my peers that I am working with and try to come up with an efficient way to tackle the workload. I will also aim to make sure I take breaks every so often, or when I notice the workload is getting to me. This is to give my brain a couple of minutes to recharge, that way I can come back to the problem with a clear mind. I will also make sure that I reach out to my family and friends to let them know that I am busy and need to divert all my attention to working / studying. It is also a great idea for me to reach out the moment I am stuck on something for more than 10-15 minutes. This will help eliminate / reduce time wasting.</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>During this course I will aim to reach out for help if I am stuck on the same thing for more than 15 minutes. I will first look on the internet to see if my answers are there. If I am still stuck then I will try to explain the problem to someone or something. If I am doing group work then I would reach out to one of the learners that I am working with and see if we can figure it out together. If I don’t figure it out from that then I will turn to one of the facilitators (at around 15 minutes of being stuck) and ask them for help</p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p>I would expect that they are familiar with all the concepts of what we learn throughout this course. I would also expect them to be able to help us to the best of their ability with any problems we might have. I might also expect them to let me know if I am falling behind at any point, or if my work is not quite up to a passing standard. </p>
        <h2 class="p-subject">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h2>
        <p>I often have appointments every Thursday afternoon that I need to attend. I also like to keep my weekend evenings free as I use this time to de-stress and spend time with family or friends. But other than that I am active online throughout most weekdays - other than Thursday afternoons. I usually have time to check discord at least once a day on the weekends as well. I know as I start the boot camp I will need to allocate at least, one full weekend day to DevAcademy work, which I have prepared for.</p>
